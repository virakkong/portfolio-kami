## Explanation

A real time chat application where you can join a room or create your own chat room.  T

## Solution

This Single Page Application (SPA) was built using the AngularJS framework. Together with FireBase NoSQL DB and AngularFire, Chat Room commits your messages to the backend and returns a promise in real time with two way data binding. 
This program is written with angular js as a structural framework and FireBase No SQL DB provided by google. It is free and easy to setup. 


## Results
User can create chatroom on their own. All messages are displayed in real time. Those data includes user's names, time of sent message, and messages. The messages data is sent to NoSQL DB of Firebase. We use AngularFire to bind data sent and recieved from NoSQl DB. 
## Conclusion
