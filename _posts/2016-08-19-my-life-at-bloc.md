title: My Life At Bloc
---

I choose bloc for three reasons:


* Curriculum
* Length of the Program
* Affordable cost

## Detail

Going to Bloc was another step for me to be a professional software engineer. I was fresh out of undergraduate school in an Electrical Engineering. I learned Java Programming I & II. Passionate about learning programming. Thatâ€™s why I looked for professional school with high rates and cost-effective. The most important things for me is to find the hand-on project to build.

Curriculum is there for me. The curiculum has three important aspects, such as Front-End, Back-End, and Final project. In each point, it has different topic and is controlled by source control. It is easier for me to keep track the work.

The length of program is very reasonable. It is just fourth and half months. Even though I feel it is very slow for me, I feel that it gives me more time to expertise checkpoints I am lack of.

The tuition is very considerable. It is about $9900 as I have  an experienced professional teachers teach me how to write the code in professional way.
