title: My Life At Bloc
---

I choose bloc for three reasons:


* Curriculum
* Length of the Program
* Affordable cost

## Detail


Going to Coding Dojo was  another step for me to be a professional software engineer. I was fresh out of undergraduate school in an Electrical Engineering. I learned Java Programming I & II. However, I found that experiences in university’s programming theories in school does not equip me enough to become a professional programmer. That’s why I looked for professional school with high rates and cost-effective.


 
 I chose Bloc over other on-site and online bootcamps for many reasons. I took one month to come up with the right boot camp. First, I went to codingdojo in Seattle. It was very intensive courses since the first week. I decided to drop because I get less attention from my instructor and co-instructor. I did not believe that I will learn enough within 14 weeks of coding. Second, I went to Thinkful. Thinkful provides three sessions mentorship. It was very fun. However, I found that Thinkful does not have enough good projects and curriculum I was looking for, particularly angular JS and Ruby. 
Now, I am at bloc. This has been fourth week since I joined bloc. Bloc created their own curriculum. I moved from one checkpoint to another checkpoint. The good idea is allowing us to sit with mentors one-on-one solving problems together. I’ve learned a lot about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Responsive Web Development (RWD), and Angular JS. Angular JS is the most difficult one. I am struggling with understanding the features such as controller, services, factory, directives, and so on. However, I like Angular JS because of its professional and structural framework. It makes a single page is run fast using post/get from the server. Even though I am struggling a lot in writing codes, I highly really recommend Bloc to future web developers who are willing to learn and put a lot of efforts in order to become a self-sufficient developer.
