title: My Life At Bloc
---

I choose bloc for three reasons:


* Curriculum
* Length of the Program
* Affordable cost

## Detail


Going to Bloc was  another step for me to be a professional software engineer. I was fresh out of undergraduate school in an Electrical Engineering. I learned Java Programming I & II. However, I found that experiences in university’s programming theories do not equip me enough to become a software engineer. That’s why I looked for professional school with high rates and cost-effective.
