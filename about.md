## PROFILE


I am a Computer and Electrical Engineer who loves designs software applications and learn new materials related to programming langauges and information technologies. My main purpose is to be a system software engineer as I can use both programming skills and computer networking skills to design a system for high standard industry.


## EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND

#### University of Washington (UW)’s Courses:
Digital Circuits and Systems, Devices and Circuits (I &II), Circuit Theory, Fundamental of Electrical Circuit, Applied electrodynamics, Technical Writing and Report, and Intro to Engineering (NXT Robotic project), Power System Fundamental, Discrete Time Linear System, and Microprocessor Systems Design, Discrete Time Linear System, Electronic Test and Measurement, Control System, statistics, Java Programming, C#. Statistics, and Azure Data Storage.


#### PROGRAMMING COURSES:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Web Design (RWD), Angular Js, Ruby on Rail, MongoDB, Express, SQL.


## KEY ARCHIEVEMENTS

Developed and created image analysis application on Azure cloud using Convex Hull (CH) and Histogram Oriented Gradients (HOC) algorithms to detect object against various backgrounds to deliver number of objects with 75% accuracy and the speed of 5-7 seconds per picture frame. This project was sponsored by Microsoft to demonstrate a real-time cloud-computing capabilities.

Successfully designed a windows server and backup server with more than 500 hundred users for an organization. 

Successfully developed a web-based inventory system for Reproductive and Child Health Alliance Organization (RACHA) to control its inventory in and out record with high satisfaction from the users.


## ENGINEERING PROJECTS

#### [Project 1: Cellular Network Camera on Quadcopter for Biology Research, 2016](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iartC-oyx5ahPNwFAe69rH_CUxEy6pl5FLfyS1xotWs/edit?usp=sharing"):

Organized, researched, and created the project to capture images and video on a quadcopter of a specific object through a mobile device and transfer to azure data storage. The project uses various algorithms to retrieve data, perform image analysis and presents the result on virtual machine through azure technologies such as Azure Data Storage, Azure App Service, Visual Studio Team Services (C#), and Virtual Machines, and MATLAB. This project used Cascade Classifier in MATLAB to train  a specific object against 1000 background images (machine learning).

#### [Project 2: Web-Based Inventory System for Reproductive and Child Health Alliance Organization (RACHA), 2006]()

Developed computer-based user interface to store and update the medical equipment inventory such as inventory in and out record and display the results on the web so that users can manipulate data and results on the web-based system through Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET and VB. NET, and crystal report from System Application & Products in Data Processing (SAP).

## PROGRAMMING PROJECTS

#### [Project 1: Music Player]()
Created a music player to allow users play musics online. Users can play, pause, forward, and backward music from the selected music albums. I used three different techniques to get the same result (project) such as plain JavaScript langaugage, JQuery lbrary, and Angular JS structural framework.

#### [Project 2: Chat Room]()
Built a real-time chat room. This Single Page Application (SPA) was built using the AngularJS framework. Together with FireBase NoSQL DB and AngularFire, Chat Room commits your messages to the backend and returns a promise in real time with two way data binding.


## EXPERIENCE
