## ENGINEERING PROJECTS

#### [Project 1: Advisory and Alerting System Project (New Horizon Product), March 2017]
(https://drive.google.com/open?id=14MW_kd2rBXawraUCSiogGSQ_7i935pSAbewQFi8x4mE)
Develop batch and power shells scripts to detect operation system’s and motor’s down time, backup failures, communication loss between Programming Logical Controller (PLC), SQL Server, and KEPServerEX.
Design system architecture solutions that fit user’s basic and optimal requirement for those systems.
Develop a system diagnostic that provides engineers a supportive tool to troubleshoot the communication issues between SQL database and New Horizon’s system. This records network communication loss and services’ errors  between KepwareServer and SQL Server.
Document all possible errors and create advisory reports for senior engineers and top managers.


#### [Project 2: Live Data of Motors Project (Achilles USA), Jan 2017]
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-NEONzqW8sHWmgzY3NudVFnV2M?usp=sharing)
Design and develop a database and responsive web pages in order to retrieve Motors’s meter tag data from Programming Logical Controller (PLC) and MS SQL and presents those data on the webpages for sale manager and CEO. All webpages are encrypted and decrypted using Crypto-JS, PHP password verification and HTTPS.


#### [Project 3: Live Data of Food Processing Project (Sheerer’s Snack)]()
Design and develop a database and responsive web pages to retrieve live data every minute, five minute, ten minutes of food processing and present those data live in table and graphics (bar chart, pie chart, Line with View Finder). 
Create reports by converting web data into different forms: Excel(CSV), Image(PNG), and Text Document (DOCX).
Develop dashboard for companies showing for live data visualization of key performance indicators based on their product operations. Dashboards utilize HTML5, PHP, Javascript, Jquery, Jquery Mobile & CSS3. Pages are accessed via tablet, mobile, desktop computer, or TV’s throughout facilities for corporate management, supervisors, & operators.

#### [Project 4: Database Security Project (Sheerer’s Snack)]
(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-NEONzqW8sHUTN6MUFvT0dBdEk?usp=sharing)
Design and Develop Database Security. All webpages are encrypted and decrypted using Crypto-JS, PHP password verification and HTTPS.

#### [Project 5: Cellular Network Camera on Quadcopter for Biology Research, 2016](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iartC-oyx5ahPNwFAe69rH_CUxEy6pl5FLfyS1xotWs/edit?usp=sharing"):

Organized, researched, and created the project to capture images and video on a quadcopter of a specific object through a mobile device and transfer to azure data storage. The project uses various algorithms to retrieve data, perform image analysis and presents the result on virtual machine through azure technologies such as Azure Data Storage, Azure App Service, Visual Studio Team Services (C#), and Virtual Machines, and MATLAB. This project used Cascade Classifier in MATLAB to train  a specific object against 1000 background images (Machine Learning).

#### [Project 6: Web-Based Inventory System for Reproductive and Child Health Alliance Organization (RACHA), 2006]()

Developed computer-based user interface to store and update the medical equipment inventory such as inventory in and out record and display the results on the web so that users can manipulate data and results on the web-based system through Microsoft technologies such as ASP.NET and VB. NET, and crystal report from System Application & Products in Data Processing (SAP).

## PROGRAMMING PROJECTS

#### [Project 1: Music Player]()
Created a music player to allow users play musics online. Users can play, pause, forward, and backward music from the selected music albums. I used three different techniques to get the same result (project) such as plain JavaScript langaugage, JQuery lbrary, and Angular JS structural framework.

#### [Project 2: Chat Room]()
Built a real-time chat room. This Single Page Application (SPA) was built using the AngularJS framework. Together with FireBase NoSQL DB and AngularFire, Chat Room commits your messages to the backend and returns a promise in real time with two way data binding.
