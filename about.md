# PROFILE

I am a Computer Software and Hardware Engineer who loves designs software applications and learn new materials related to programming langauges and information technologies. My destiny leads me to be a professoinal software and electrical engineer.

 I finished my engineering major at University of Washington. My capstone focuses on image analysis using Azure as a web database plaform and C# as my programming language (For more information about my Project, please click on below link to my linkedin profile). 

# KEY ARCHIEVEMENTS

-  Successfully completed capstone project on Cellular Network Camera on Quadcopter for Biology Research.
-  Successfully Became US citizen as of August, 2014 ‘US Person’ and an Active (or ability to obtain) U.S. Security Clearance, an ability to obtain an interim and/or final clearance (prestart) is required for this positionUS Citizenship Required
- Successfully completed research and development (R&D) in Computer Network
and Server 2003 with Professor Chan Nat, the director of Batouk Computer Center System from September 2002 to September 2004.
-  Interned in developing a Database Management System (Stock Management System) for IT manager of the Reproductive and Child Health Alliance Organization (RACHA) from December 2004 to December 2005. 

# PROJECTS

## [Project 1: Cellular Network Camera on Quadcopter for Biology Research ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iartC-oyx5ahPNwFAe69rH_CUxEy6pl5FLfyS1xotWs/edit?usp=sharing"):

    - Facilitate biologists in collecting data by using cellular network camera system mounted on a quadcopter. 
    - Implement advanced image analysis algorithm in OpenCV to observe crows to sophisticated data collection and analysis.  
    - Utilize  Microsoft  Azure  2015,a  cloud  computing  platform,  to  receive  the  images  taken  by  the  camera  and  perform  image analysis on the web to determine the number of crows presented.  
    - Use  ARM  microprocessor  (Raspberry  Pi  2  B+)  that  is  capable  of  running  Microsoft  Windows  10  Internet  of  Things  (IoT) Core  and  other  compatible  components,  such  as  A/V  interception  devices,  WIFI  dongle,  USB  Hub  using  U-brackets, Transmitter and Receivers (RX-1260 2.4GHz).  
    - Connect  the  microprocessor  to  the  Internet  via  a  chosen  cellular  network  such  that  images  taken  by  the  camera  can  be transmitted to our data storage on Microsoft Azure’s virtual Data Center Server.  
    - Write two software programs to (1) capture images and videos then send those data to Azure Cloud service (data storage) and (2)  perform  simple  analysis  on  the  collected  images  and  send  the  results  to  a  ground-based  computer  via  Microsoft  Azure Servers  where  biologists  may  use  them  for  their  research.  The  complete  cellular  network  camera  system  is  enclosed  and mounted on a quadcopter to improve its convenience and mobility.
